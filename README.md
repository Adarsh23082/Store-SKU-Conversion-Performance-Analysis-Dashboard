# 📊 Store & SKU Conversion Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize the conversion performance of various stores and SKUs (Stock Keeping Units). The goal is to uncover performance trends, identify top and underperforming entities, and derive actionable insights for business growth.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of:

- Store-level conversion rates.
- SKU-level conversion performance.
- Total revenue contribution by conversion rate.
- Comparative analysis of top and bottom performers.
- Interactive filtering based on Store ID and SKU ID.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Top-performing Stores**: Store_39 and Store_49 showed the highest average conversion rates across SKUs.
- **Underperforming Stores**: Store_12 and Store_30 had the lowest conversion rates, indicating potential areas for improvement.
- **High-performing SKUs**: SKU_11, SKU_7, and SKU_16 consistently achieved high conversion rates across stores.
- **Low-performing SKUs**: SKU_17 and SKU_8 underperformed, suggesting a need for further investigation.

## 🧠 Recommendations

- **Focus on Replicating Success**: Study strategies and practices in top-performing stores (e.g., Store_39) and apply them to underperforming stores.
- **Product Optimization**: Consider repositioning or improving low-performing SKUs like SKU_17 to boost their conversion rates.
- **Revenue Strategy**: Leverage the correlation between higher conversion rates and increased revenue to prioritize store-SKU combinations that drive growth.
